# Webroot mode: certbot will create challenge file in the specified webroot to verify domain.
# Make sure that given webroot-path is exposed via your http server!
#
# https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#webroot
# The webroot plugin works by creating a temporary file for each of your requested domains in: 
# ${webroot-path}/.well-known/acme-challenge.
# Then the Letâ€™s Encrypt validation server makes HTTP requests to validate that the DNS for each requested domain
# resolves to the server running certbot. An example request made to your web server would look like:
# 66.133.109.36 - - [05/Jan/2016:20:11:24 -0500] "GET /.well-known/acme-challenge/HGr8U1IeTW4kY_Z6UIyaakzOkyQgPr_7ArlLgtZE8SX HTTP/1.1" 200 87 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Let's Encrypt validation server; +https://www.letsencrypt.org)"

# You can check renewal by running: sudo certbot renew --dry-run.
