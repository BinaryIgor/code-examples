# HTMX MPA vs React SPA

Let's compare Multi Page Application, boosted with HTMX for partial updates, with Single Page Application implemented with the help of React!

We will mostly compare:
* subjective user experience
* page load speed & performance - how much do we need to wait for the page to be fully functional and usable?
* code complexity

It's a simple app that allows to manage projects and their tasks. It looks something like this:
![projects](projects.png)
![new-project](new-project.png)
![tasks](tasks.png)

## What is here
